# VisionGuard-AI-Driven-Real-Time-Missing-Person-Detection-System
An AI-based real-time missing person detection system using facial recognition. It highlights identified persons with a red circle and others with a green circle, ensuring quick and efficient recognition. No database is required, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. 
Real-Time Missing Person Detection using AI

Description
This project is an AI-based real-time missing person detection system using facial recognition. It compares real-time camera feed with stored images of missing persons. If a match is found, the system highlights the person with a red circle, otherwise, a green circle is used. The project is designed for fast and efficient recognition without requiring a database, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

Features
‚úÖ Real-time facial recognition using OpenCV and Deep Learning
‚úÖ Highlights detected persons (Red for missing, Green for normal)
‚úÖ No database required, making it simple and lightweight
‚úÖ User-friendly interface for seamless interaction
‚úÖ Deployable on any system with a webcam

Technologies Used
Python üêç
OpenCV (Computer Vision)
Deep Learning (Face Recognition)
Flask (For Web Interface)
HTML, CSS (For Frontend)

Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository

Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/missing-person-detection.git
cd missing-person-detection
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
bash

Edit
python app.py
4. Open in Browser
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the system.


How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload or store images of missing persons in the designated folder.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The camera feed will compare every face detected with the stored images.
3Ô∏è‚É£ If a match is found, a red circle will be drawn around the face.
4Ô∏è‚É£ If no match is found, a green circle will be drawn around the face.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The system can run continuously to identify missing persons in real-time.


Deployment Strategies
üîπ Local Deployment: Run directly on your computer with Python and OpenCV.
üîπ Cloud Deployment: Use platforms like Google Colab, AWS, or Azure to deploy online.
üîπ Web Hosting: Host with Flask & Gunicorn for a web-based interface.
üîπ Edge Devices: Deploy on Raspberry Pi for portable and offline detection.
